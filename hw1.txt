In this homework, I went through the the thurough instructions given in the hw instructions. Then as I followed the instructions I got to the end and ran into a big problem. The code returned an error and said that the connection to my github page and repository were not found. I tried to go back and figure out where my mistake was; however, this did not work. To fix this problem I went and created another github account and started from scratch. I carefully went through the instructions again and when I reached the end of the suggested code to input, everything worked perfectky and immediately added the code up to my github page

mkidr .dotfiles
ls -a          
cd .dotfiles
pwd
touch README.md
vi README.md
cat README.md
cd ..              
cp .vimrc .dotfiles
cd .dotfiles
git init
git add --all
git commit -m "INIT commit"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin git@github.com:AaronsMoore25/.dotfiles
git push -u origin main

I did not use any outside sources to help me with this homework
